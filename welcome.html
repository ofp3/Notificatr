	<h2>Welcome to an\note.</h2>

	<h2>How it works:</h2>
	<p><strong>an\note</strong> is a simple, in-browser note taking application. It is designed to let you write notes in 
	a clean, well-formatted, and highly readable way. 
	<br><br>
	The <strong>an\note</strong> engine is focused around tags. A tag, denoted by a backslash (\) marks special parts 
	of your notes. There are tags for equations (\eq...\eq*), theorems (\thm...\thm*), and many other useful types of 
	information. Anything enclosed in tags can be searched for later and the <strong>an\note</strong> engine will 
	extract only the information that you are looking for.
	<br><br>
	In addition, <strong>an\note</strong> has full markdown support. This means that any markdown style formatting you
	do will be automatically transferred to the html version of your notes, which can be both saved and printed.
